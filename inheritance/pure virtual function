-->pure virtual function: Declared in superclass's .h file and set to 0(null).

-->An absent function that has not been implemented.

–->Must be implemented by any subclass, or it cannot be used.

–-> A way of forcing subclasses to add certain important behavior.

class Employee {
    ...
    virtual void work() = 0; // every employee does
    // some kind of work
};

– FYI: In Java, this is called an abstract method.
