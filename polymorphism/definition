-->Polymorphism is the the ability for the same code to
be used with different types of objects and behave
differently with each.

example::

Lawyer *ken = new Lawyer(“Ken”, 10, “GWU”);

HeadTA *zach = new HeadTA(“Zach”, 1, “CS106X”);


//Employee class here is a superclass of both Lawyer and HeadTA
Vector<Employee *> all = { ken, zach };

//the same function call works differently for different Employee
cout << all[0]->getHoursWorkedPerWeek() << endl; // 40

cout << all[1]->getHoursWorkedPerWeek() << endl; // 20
