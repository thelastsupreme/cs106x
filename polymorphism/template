• With templates, we create one class that works with any type of parameter:

template<typename T>
class Vector {
…
}

• This is also polymorphism; C++ knows to execute different code for
Vector<int> vs. Vector<string> , even though they are all
Vectors.

• At compile-time, C++ generates a version of this class for each type
it will be used with. This is called compile-time polymorphism.
